# AoC2020 - Advent of Code 2020

This repository includes my (attempts at) solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) 
challenges.

Each day has its own directory. The code computing the answers is always called `puzzle.py`, while the input file is 
called `input.txt`.

The code is written in python. I try not to use anything that is not included in base 3.7 python. If I do, I  will use 
pipenv for dependency management.

You can run the solution for day 1 with the following code:
```bash
cd day1
python puzzle.py
```
